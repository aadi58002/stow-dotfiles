# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
font-family = "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono"

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
# 
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
background-opacity = 0.8

# Valid values:
# 
#   * `true`
#   * `false` - windows won't have native decorations, i.e. titlebar and
#      borders. On macOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
# 
# The "toggle_window_decorations" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.
window-decoration = false

# Whether to automatically copy selected text to the clipboard. `true`
# will prefer to copy to the selection clipboard if supported by the
# OS, otherwise it will copy to the system clipboard.
# 
# The value `clipboard` will always copy text to the selection clipboard
# (for supported systems) as well as the system clipboard. This is sometimes
# a preferred behavior on Linux.
# 
# Middle-click paste will always use the selection clipboard on Linux
# and the system clipboard on macOS. Middle-click paste is always enabled
# even if this is `false`.
# 
# The default value is true on Linux and false on macOS. macOS copy on
# select behavior is not typical for applications so it is disabled by
# default. On Linux, this is a standard behavior so it is enabled by
# default.
copy-on-select = false

# Confirms that a surface should be closed before closing it. This defaults to
# true. If set to false, surfaces will close without any confirmation.
confirm-close-surface = false
